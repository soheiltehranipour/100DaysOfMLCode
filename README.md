# 100DaysOfMLCode
My journey to Applied Machine Learning has been started today (09/30/2018) based on #100daysofmlcode and [sirajraval](https://github.com/llSourcell) . It is all about dedicating at least 1 hour studying or coding Machine Learning daily. Iâ€™m going to post the details in my github and also in our official website (www.iran-machinelearning.ir)
## [Day 000 - Introduction](https://github.com/soheiltehranipour/100DaysOfMLCode/blob/master/Day%20000-%20Intro.ipynb)

Introduction and some How To's for starting Data Science and Machine Learning with a little of Python Programming and its data structures.

## [Day 001 - Numpy](https://github.com/soheiltehranipour/100DaysOfMLCode/blob/master/Day%20001-%20Numpy.ipynb)

Numpy From Scratch. 

## [Day 002 - Pandas](https://github.com/soheiltehranipour/100DaysOfMLCode/blob/master/Day%20002%20-%20Pandas.ipynb)

Now it's time to get our hands dirty and doing some Data manipulation with Pandas. Titanic Dataset is used here.

## Day 003 - Visualization (Matplotlib & Seaborn)

## Day 004 - Regression

## Day 005 - Gradient Descent

## Day 006 - XGBoost
